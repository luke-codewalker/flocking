# flocking
 Website demonstrating a flocking simulation. Inspired by [Daniel Shiffmann](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). 
 
 Flocking is a combination of three different desires that the vehicles on the screen have:
  - separation: how much does a vehicle want to separate from other vehicles
  - cohesion: how much does a vehicle want to stay together with other vehicles
  - alignment: how much does a vehicle want to move in the average direction the vehicles around it
  
 All these variables can be controlled with the sliders on the page. Play around with them and wait a while for the change to take it's full effect. 
 Also don't forget to check out the color schemes.
 
 Have fun and use this repository for any issues <3
